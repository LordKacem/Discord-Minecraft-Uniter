A discord bot allowing you to join cracked minecraft servers and access the chat just like a normal minecraft client.

# FAQ

**How to set up the bot?**

Fill in your bot token and the channel ID where the bot will be working in config.json

**How to use the bot?**

It is a simple command ".login <Username> <Server_IP>"

**Why is the bot being slow sometimes?**

Due to discord limitations, bots are only able to send 5 messages at once. Therefore if the chat is updating quickly it is hard for the bot to keep track of it at real-time.
